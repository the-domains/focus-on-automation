This is _Focus on Automation_.

Here we explore automation solutions and code for most processes, and how they can benefit everyone. One use case at a time.

Let's start with Python, the programming language I have been using for more than 10 years now.

From Python official site's _about_ page, here is a quote I like:

## "Python is powerful... and fast;   
plays well with others;   
runs everywhere;   
is friendly & easy to learn;   
is Open."
